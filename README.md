# todo-react-rails
## Readme

Hi there, this is a simple todo list built with RoR and React. It allows users to sign up and have a simple, private task list.

It is currently hosted at todo-react-rails.mikesimmonds.io on a free Heroku dyno. This may mean it will take 20s to load - but will run smoothly after initial startup.

This is not really suitable for mobile.
